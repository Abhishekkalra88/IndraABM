Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:06.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,We will modify a prototype model (basic model in basic.py) \N into a real segregation model
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.50,0:00:10.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,step by step to show that new developers don't have to start from scratch
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.50,0:00:15.20,字幕,,0,0,0,,But before we get started, let me have a brief introduction of segregation model
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.20,0:00:22.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,The goal is to show that people with mild in-group preference towards their own group, could still lead to a highly segregated society
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.50,0:00:26.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,Next let's get into changing the code. I will explain more during the process.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.50,0:00:31.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,Firstly, let's manage our agent settings like agent names and agent numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.00,0:00:36.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,Each model will have a parameter called grp_struct which is a dictionary
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.00,0:00:40.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,that contains group agent info either as a default constant
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.00,0:00:46.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,or as a variable mapping to a specified value in [MODEL_NAME].props.json
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.00,0:00:48.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,let's look at the basic_grps:
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.00,0:00:51.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,We can see two keys: blue_grp and red_grp.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.00,0:00:54.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,Those are the group names that you can customize.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.00,0:00:56.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,Let's see inside what we have in blue_grp.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.50,0:01:02.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,The first attribute defines what the agent will do at each turn when the model is running.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.00,0:01:06.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,What the agent will do is specified in a function called basic_action
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.00,0:01:08.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,We will dig into this function later
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.50,0:01:15.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,The second and third attributes together define the number of agents that we want to have.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.50,0:01:22.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,mdl.NUM_MBRS_PROP specifies that we are going to read the number of blue agents from the variable num_blue
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.50,0:01:26.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,which is defined in the [MODEL_NAME].props.json
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.50,0:01:36.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,If we fail to get the property value, the fallback method would be to get the value from DEF_BLUE_MBRS constant which we specified in the second attribute
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.50,0:01:41.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,Let's play around a bit to see how the changes in this setting affect the model
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.50,0:01:45.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,You can see the value for num_blue and num_red in props.json file is 2
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.50,0:01:48.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,Change the value for num_blue to 4
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.50,0:02:15.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,Now we see that the default input for the number of blue agents is 4,\N while that number for red agents is 2
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.50,0:02:32.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,We can see that the numbers of agents are the default numbers when the model is running
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.50,0:02:38.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,Then we try to give our input for the numbers of agents
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.50,0:02:55.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,Type in 8
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.50,0:03:13.50,字幕,,0,0,0,,The number of blue agents changed to 8
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.00,0:03:26.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,Now we try to remove the 'num_blue' and see the default value DEF_BLUE_MBRS to take effect.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.00,0:03:44.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,Renaming num_blue to num_green in basci_props.json
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.00,0:03:52.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,Now mdl.NUM_MBRS_PROP fail to get the property value
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.00,0:04:25.00,字幕,,0,0,0,,The the number of agents is the value from DEF_BLUE_MBRS constant which we specified in the second attribute
