Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:05.00,v0,,0,0,0,,Next, we will focus on the action of agents
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:13.00,v0,,0,0,0,,Basically there are mainly two parts of action you need to define in your new model
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.00,0:00:18.00,v0,,0,0,0,,The agent first surveys the environment
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.00,0:00:23.00,v0,,0,0,0,,The second is to respond to the result of that survey
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.00,0:00:37.00,v0,,0,0,0,,So we need to define a function (we call agent_action in ABM system) to show how the agent surveys the environment and its response to the result
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.00,0:00:50.00,v0,,0,0,0,,In segregation model, the agent first surveys the environment and find the ratio of agents in the same group
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.00,0:01:04.00,v0,,0,0,0,,We could call a predefined function called neighbor_ratio() to easily get the ratio
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.00,0:01:13.00,v0,,0,0,0,,Then, we need to define its response to the result of the survey
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.00,0:01:15.00,v0,,0,0,0,, It is rather simple
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.00,0:01:25.00,v0,,0,0,0,,If the ratio is no less than its tolerance which means the agent is happy about where it is, it will stay put
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.00,0:01:32.00,v0,,0,0,0,,If the ratio is less than its tolerance, it will move
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.00,0:01:42.00,v0,,0,0,0,,We define two helper functions and some default values to make the structure clearer
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.00,0:01:50.00,v0,,0,0,0,,The first function(get_tolerance) is used to calculate a tolerant number  
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.00,0:01:57.00,v0,,0,0,0,,In this case, we don't assign a uniform tolerance rate for all agents
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.00,0:02:09.00,v0,,0,0,0,,Instead, we have a default tolerance rate and assign values in the manner of gauss distribution around it to the agents
